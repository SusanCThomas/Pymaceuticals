## [Pymaceuticals-Matplotlib](https://github.com/SusanCThomas/Pymaceuticals-Matplotlib/tree/main/Pymaceuticals)

Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. The most recent animal study identified 249 mice wtih SCC tumor growth that were treated through a variety of drug regimens. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. This analysis includes the generation of tables and figures needed for the technical part of the study. Also included is a top-level summary of the study results.
